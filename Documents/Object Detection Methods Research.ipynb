    "R-CNN works by selecting 2000 regions from the image by recursively combining similar regions into larger ones. This allows the algorithm to work with a set\n",
    "number of regions as opposed to an almost infinite amount of region choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CNN attempts to extract features from the region proposols, and those features are fed into an output dense layer. This feeds into an SVM to classify the presence of objects within those regions. Additionally, it attempts to predict offset values to improve the precision of the bounding box.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular R-CNN is incredibly slow and could not run in real time. So Fast R-CNN was made by changing the algorithm to only do the convolution operation once per image, and removing the need to feed 2000 region proposols for every image.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also Faster R-CNN, which attempts to speed up the region proposal creation process by letting the neural network learn the regions, instead of the time consuming selection process."

    "\n",
    "One of the downfalls of earlier YOLO versions was the inability to detect small sized objects in an image. YOLOv3 tries to amend this by downscaling images and building features on multiple resolutions of the input images."
