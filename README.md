# Springboard Machine Learning Course Capstone Project

### Author: Scott Gibson
### Start Date: September Cohort, 2022

---

This repository will hold the work and analysis of my Capstone project for this course.

The current project will attempt to teach a Deep Neural Network to analyze an image and
identify and highlight objects of interest. (cars, pedestrians, etc.)

### Datasets

Since the datasets used in this project will be composed of thousands of images, I will not be
posting them to GitHub. There will be at least one file in the Data directory giving credit to
the original source of the data, so please go to that if you're interested.
